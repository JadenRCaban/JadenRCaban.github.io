- I began with pseudo code and then had to readjust my expectations because i knew what i wanted to complete would not get there in time, however i still plan on finishing this website. 
- Currently i made psudeo code for the main page, artist link page, and the news page. 
- I then gathered all of the media that needed to be used on the website and i made folders for each the audio and the photos.
- I then continued editing the text to get to what i wanted, and when i got stuck i asked chatgpt or blackbox.ai to help. 
- I had trouble and spent the most time on trying to get a 3d visual model on the home page. I ended up scarping that idea for the sake of time and added a gif image instead.
